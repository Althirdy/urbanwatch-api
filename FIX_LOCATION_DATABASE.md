## Steps to Fix Location Database Issue

The location data wasn't being saved because:

1. The `location_categories` table was empty or didn't exist
2. There's a FOREIGN KEY constraint that requires valid category IDs
3. The database wasn't properly seeded

### Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Run all pending migrations (including the new coordinate type fix)
php artisan migrate

# 2. Seed the database with location categories and other initial data
php artisan db:seed

# 3. (Optional) Check if categories were created
php artisan tinker
>>> App\Models\LocationCategory::all();
```

### After running these commands:

- The `location_categories` table will be populated with 12 categories
- The `locations` table structure will have proper decimal types for coordinates
- New locations will be successfully saved when you submit the form

### If you get an error about foreign key constraints:

Run:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This will reset all tables and reseed them from scratch.

### To verify it works:

1. Go back to the Locations page
2. Click "Add Location"
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. Check phpMyAdmin - you should now see the data in the `locations` table
